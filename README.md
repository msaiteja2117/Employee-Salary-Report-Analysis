# Employee Salary Report Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a large employee salary dataset using Python. The goal is to clean, transform, and explore the data in order to derive insights on compensation trends, including base pay, overtime, and total compensation across various job titles and years.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional)

## Project Description
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, replaced inconsistencies (e.g., "Not Provided" with NaN), and dropped irrelevant columns (like ID, Notes, Agency, and Status).
- **Data Transformation:** Converted raw CSV data into a structured format by performing necessary preprocessing steps.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Utilized Pandas functions (`describe()`, `info()`, etc.) to generate summary statistics, assess data quality, and visualize trends.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Identified trends in employee salaries across different years and job titles, such as analyzing the occurrence of specific roles (e.g., those containing "Captain") and comparing base pay distributions.

## Getting Started
